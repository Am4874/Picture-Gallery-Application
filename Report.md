# Picture Gallery Report

## Approach

- The picture gallery was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
- The HTML file (`index.html`) contains the structure of the gallery. 
- The CSS file (`styles.css`) is used to style the gallery, making it responsive and visually appealing. 
- The JavaScript file (`main.js`) is use to handle user interactions, such as searching for pictures and updating the UI dynamically and fetch picture,descriptions, url for User interactions for both search and home UI.
- Using **Unsplash** for API requests for  get pictures and there data and information from api.

## Challenges

1. **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the gallery is responsive and looks good on different screen sizes was a challenge. This was addressed by using Grid layout (`grid`) and flex box layout (`flexbox`) setting appropriate widths and heights for the gallery container and  gallery items and there data(descriptions,url,images).

2. **Fetch Pictures**: Ensure that the categories are entered in the search, retrieve the gallery items (pictures, descriptions, URLs, images) in response, and display them properly in the gallery container. Additionally, present these items on the home page after the page loads.

3. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Ensuring the gallery works consistently across different browsers required testing and minor adjustments in CSS.

Overall, the development process was straightforward, and the final picture gallery meets the requirements.
