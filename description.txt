Instructions:

Create a picture gallery application that allows users to enter a category name, such as "food" or "landscape", and retrieve relevant pictures from Unsplash.com using their API.

The picture gallery should have the following features:

A text input field where users can enter a category name
A button that allows users to search for pictures based on the category name
A grid that displays the retrieved pictures, with each picture having a constant size
The ability to display the picture author, description, and link to the original picture on Unsplash.com
Use Javascript to handle user interactions, such as searching for pictures and updating the UI dynamically.

Use CSS to style the picture gallery and make it visually appealing. The grid should be responsive and become a single column if viewed on a mobile device.

Use HTML to create the structure of the picture gallery.

Test the picture gallery thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly and meets all requirements.

Submit the complete picture gallery, including all source code, along with a short report explaining your approach and any challenges you faced.

Note: You can use any front-end framework or library that you are comfortable with, such as React or Angular or Javascript/JQuery, but the emphasis should be on demonstrating your skills in Javascript, CSS, HTML, and API calls.
